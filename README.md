# SmartHomePy

I will attempt to make an app to connect Phillips Hue lights, Smarthings sensors and other smart home products. The goal is:

1. To make a personalised local web app to control connected devices. The main reason for this is to make it easier to create in-depth combinations.
2. I would like to be able to create little buttons or dials to put around the house that connect to a python function to control the lights. (Most companies have some light control products already, but they’re expensive, so this would also be a great alternative for that)
3. I’m going to try to connect the code with the buttons through a RaspberryPi so I wouldn’t always have to have my computer running to use the functions.
